# library-management-system-with-QR-code-login
This is a library management system for my college, which uses QR code login to log in and borrow and return books.
<br>First need to generate a QR code for the new students and then use the generated QR code to log in to the website homepage.
When get into the website mainpage will see two buttons which is for borrow and return books.
